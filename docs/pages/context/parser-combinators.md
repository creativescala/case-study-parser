## Parser Combinators

Parser combinators have been around for a while. There is more work than I can possibly summarize here, so I just want to do three things:

- point out some of the classic papers in the area;
- mention a few of the Scala parser combinator libraries, and draw some lessons from them; and
- look at a few relatively recent developments that I find interesting.
